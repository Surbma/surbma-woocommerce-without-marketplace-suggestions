Remove WooCommerce Marketplace Suggestions from admin permanently.

== Description ==

Say good bye to all WooCommerce Marketplace Suggestions!

>"They are contextual mentions of official extensions that may be relevant to a customer..."
>~ Todd Wilkens, Head of WooCommerce

**Thank you Todd, but no!** We don't need it. There is no need to add more place for ads on the admin. WooCommerce store owners need a clean interface instead.

So WooCommerce 3.6 brought us new ways to monetize the WordPress community. WooCommerce Marketplace Suggestions are showing up on product pages in the admin area. This plugin will turn them off, so no more Marketplace Suggestions will show up.

Yes you can dismiss the suggestions, but only for a time, they will come back soon. The Surbma | WooCommerce Without Marketplace Suggestions plugin will remove them permanently, so you won't see them again.

There is no options for this plugin, it just works. When you activate the plugin, it will turn off WooCommerce Marketplace Suggestions. So really, it is that easy.

There is no impact on the front-end, not in speed or anything else. This is a very safe and easy way to get rid off WooCommerce Marketplace Suggestions forever.
